***Project Ideas***  

1)	Remote monitoring system for 3D printers in SJSU Makerspace using Raspberry Pi-
SJSU Makerspace in College Of Engineering requires an automated monitoring system for 3D printers and we are planning to implement it using Raspberry Pi. We plan on using a Wifi Module to connect and gather data and communicate using LAN.

2)	Packet Sniffer for IoT- MQTT, AMQP, TCP, UDP.
A network monitoring tool which is distributed, AWS Lambda, Python code for on premise device, send telemetry data to cloud.

3)	Travelerâ€™s Friend/ Travel Buddy-Ad hoc Profile matching-
Communication Protocol using VoIP SIP protocol, Transmitter-Receiver Antennas hardware using raspberry pi Wifi.

4)	Chat application with File Transfer for multiple users
